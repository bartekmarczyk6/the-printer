# The Printer - Cryptocurrency Arbitrage System

Disclaimer:
This project was created in 2021 as a first serious project for learning programming. It may be incomplete or some parts may not function correctly. However, it aims to showcase a creative approach to arbitrage strategies in the crypto space. This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any financial gain.

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose

The "Printer" project is an advanced cryptocurrency arbitrage system that utilizes flash loans to execute arbitrage transactions across various DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges).

### Arbitrage Opportunity Detection

The core of the arbitrage detection mechanism lies within the `printer_heart/algorithms/spfa.ts` file, which implements the Shortest Path Faster Algorithm (SPFA). This algorithm is used to find negative cycles in a graph representing DEX liquidity pools. Each node in the graph represents a token, and each edge represents a swap between two tokens on a specific DEX. The weight of an edge is the negative logarithm of the swap price, so a negative cycle indicates an arbitrage opportunity.

The `SPFA` function takes a graph name, a list of starting vertices (tokens), and a provider as input. It queries the Redis Graph database to retrieve the edges and vertices of the graph. It then initializes distances and predecessors for each vertex. The algorithm iterates through all edges, updating distances and predecessors if a shorter path is found. After the main loop, it checks for negative cycles. If a negative cycle is detected, it constructs the arbitrage path by traversing the predecessors. It then queries the database for additional information about the edges in the path, such as amounts, reserves, and fee tiers. Finally, it calls the `checkLoanPossibility` function from `printer_heart/loan/loan_amount.ts` to check if the arbitrage opportunity is profitable and execute the flash loan transaction.

### Early Termination

The `printer_heart/algorithms/early_termination.ts` file implements an early termination optimization. The `createArbPath` function identifies if there is a cycle in the path and returns the shortest path. The `earlyTermination` function takes an edge path, a token path, a swap token, a provider, and a maximum number of hops as input. It calls `createArbPath` to check if there is a cycle in the path. If a cycle is found, it calls the `checkLoanPossibility` function with the shortened path. This optimization prevents the algorithm from exploring longer paths that contain cycles, which are not profitable.
